# wiseDisplay
wiseDisplay is a web app that can display sports scores like a scoreboard. It works on any device with a browser, but it is especially designed for tablets that can be left on a shelf or mounted on a wall. You can choose to display the scores of NFL, NBA, NHL and/or MLB games, display only live games, and highlight your favorite teams when they're playing. The app will automatically update the scores and rotate the games every few seconds.

## Why I created this project
I created this project because I love sports and I wanted to have a convenient way to keep track of the games without having to constantly check my phone or computer. I also wanted to create a simple and elegant display that would fit in any room and enhance the atmosphere. I was inspired by the scoreboards that you see in stadiums and arenas, and I wanted to recreate that experience at home.
